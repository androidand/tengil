notes: |
  Official Jellyfin setup optimized for Tengil.
  
  Configuration:
  - Uses bridge networking (not host mode) for better isolation
  - Read-only media mounts (safety)
  - GPU passthrough commented out (enable if needed)
  
  Security considerations:
  - Set up user authentication immediately after first run
  - Enable HTTPS if exposing to internet
  - Read-only media mounts prevent accidental deletion
  
  Hardware transcoding:
  - Intel QuickSync: Uncomment /dev/dri device mapping
  - NVIDIA: Uncomment nvidia runtime and env vars
  - Requires Proxmox GPU passthrough setup
